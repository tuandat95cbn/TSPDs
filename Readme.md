Combining trucks and drones in delivering parcels is emerging research in recent years. 

In this thesis, We propose another problem name TSP-mD (TSPDs) travel salesman problem with multiple drones by extending the previous work from Ha el. at. 

We also propose an algorithm to solve and integrate the algorithm with an ERP web application using spring and ofbiz framework.
